# Liquid Staking Research

Chorus One has received a grant from the [Interchain Foundation](https://interchain.io/) to explore the concept of Liquid Staking (also referred to as Programmable Staking or Staking Derivatives). 

During the four month project, we will explore the different ways staked assets will be tokenized and the implications on the sustainability of the Internet of Blockchains. The Liquid Staking Working Group will continue to hold discussions after delivery of the report (June 2020).

The deliverable of the project are as follows:
- [A research report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eP2w_pZEZlSbKDHqG-Zf5cZXbk2ZH4BWFEqu-KeoGeQ/edit#)
